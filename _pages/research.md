# Research Interests

## General Profile

- Substantively, my work focuses on how politico-economic and socio-cultural factors shape digitalization and refract it into different geographic and temporal varieties. On the one hand, I look at various ways in which social interests, political institutions, and ideas influence the ways in which digital technologies and companies are regulated and responded to, be it in the area of data protection (GDPR), transport regulation (Uber), or public investment (education, R&D, e-government). On the other hand, I look at the non-economic factors that legitimate, orient, and motivate digital enterpreneurs, complementing the politico-economic perspective with arguments from economic sociology.

- Theoretically, I take up Max Weber's old question of how ideas can become 'effective forces in history'. In other words, I'm interested in how things like belief systems, narratives, or policy ideas affect the political processes in and through which digitalization is -- or is not -- regulated. Ideas, however, are not treated in isolation from institutional or structural factors. Rather, I look at the ways in which self-interested actors use ideas to advance their interests, how ideas become embedded in institutions, how ideas instantiate underlying economic and institutional logics, or how ideas change the ways in which actors perceive and conceive of digitalization. 

- Methodologically, I try to live by William Sewell’s dictum that social science “will advance more surely by allowing intellectual problems to determine its methods than by allowing methods to determine its intellectual problems.”. Accordingly, I use a variety of methods from large-N regressions to interviews to answer the questions that interest me substantively. Given my theoretical proclivities, I am particularly interested in using text-as-data methods to systematically test ideational explanations, trying to challenge Philip Converse's old quip that ideas are “primary exhibits for the doctrine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study”.

- Geographically, I focus on Europe and North America, with studies on the local, national as well as supranational (EU) level.

## Current Research Projects

In my disseration, I start from the observation that while much has been written about how policymakers should react to the challenges posed by digitalization much less has been written on why policymakers react the way they do. In other words, why do policymakers often react to challenges like the regulation of platform work, the protection of personal data, or the growing demands for human capital and innovation-enabling infrastructures in widely different ways. Specifically, I´m interested in i) the regulation of digital platforms that intermediate labor such as Uber; ii) the differences in the extent to which governments invest in what I call digital goods, i.e. the things that make individuals and firms thrive in a digital economy (e.g. education, R&D, broadband, e-government, etc), and iii) the implementation of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation in different European countries.

I also have a project (with Moritz Laurer) that looks at why the General Data Protection Regulation was adopted in the first place, despite resistance of many member states and heavy-handed lobbying by well-informed and deep-pocketed business groups, using process tracing and discourse network analysis. We argue and show empirically how institutional legacies triggered and structured the policy-making process, and how the Snoweden revelations saved the GDPR from being watered down.

Another project (with Oliver Nachtwey) looks at digitalization from a econommic sociology perspective, trying to get a grasp of the “spirit of digital capitalism”, that is, the sets of normative beliefs that motivate, legitimate and orient the actions of Silicon Valley (and other digital) entrepreneurs, using content analysis and supervised learning techniques on large text corpora.

Yet another project (with Matteo Marenco) uses various text-as-data approaches on a novel dataset of text corpora to analyse how countries talk about the digital transformation of work, and what they talk about when they talk about this. The idea is that different institutional and cultural legacies should not only affect the way countries respond to digitalization but also the way they perceive and conceive it in the first place - in other words, digitaliaztion is not only not the same everywhere, it might not even be the same problem everywhere.

A final project (with Anton Hemerijck and Maciej Sobocinski) is more theoretical and even programmatic in nature and asks which tools institutional scholars should use to make sense of the politics of high-uncertainty, transformative change.

## Previous projects

Despite my current focus on the comparative political economy of digitalization, I´m intellectually quite “promiscuous”, having worked on German foreign policy during the Euro crisis, the relationship between Germany and its former colony Namibia, the relevance of recent findings in evolutionary anthropology and moral psychology for the social sciences, the biographical differences between those members of the Forbes 400 that have made their money with digital technologies and those who haven´t, and, lastly, the role of morality in economic life.
